# Rainfall-Analysis

- The dataset encompasses rainfall data spanning from 1901 to 2020, offering detailed records for each year and quarter for every state in India, with a focus on Bihar.
- An analysis was conducted by grouping Bihar's data based on its sub-divisional column, providing insights into the region's rainfall patterns.
- Visualizations were generated to showcase Bihar's annual rainfall trends, highlighting variations and tendencies over the years.
- Quarterly rainfall patterns within Bihar were also visualized, offering a granular understanding of seasonal fluctuations in precipitation.
- Additionally, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model was incorporated into the analysis. This advanced model was trained using historical rainfall data from Bihar, enabling predictions for future rainfall trends in the region.
- The LSTM model's integration enhances the dataset's utility by forecasting potential future rainfall scenarios in Bihar, aiding in proactive planning and decision-making processes for various sectors reliant on weather patterns.
